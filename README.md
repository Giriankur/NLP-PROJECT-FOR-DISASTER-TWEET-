# NLP-PROJECT-FOR-DISASTER-TWEET-
NLP PROJECT FOR DISASTER TWEET CLASSIFICATION 
1. Overview
The Disaster Tweet Classification project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets into two categories:

Disaster-related tweets
Non-disaster tweets
The aim is to build a machine learning model that can effectively differentiate between these tweet types to assist in disaster management and response.

2. Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Disaster Tweets Competition. It contains:

id: Unique identifier for each tweet.
text: The content of the tweet.
target: Binary label (1: disaster tweet, 0: non-disaster tweet).
3. Objective
To develop a robust classification model that achieves high accuracy and generalizability in identifying disaster-related tweets.

4. Technologies Used
